___

#### To do a soft line break in Figma, press SHIFT + ENTER

#### Line height and letter spacing options for text are under font weight option

#### Figma always "remembers" and uses the last used setting on a new element

#### When creating a text box, after inputing text, double click the corner to make it auto fit according to the text inside it

#### To create a new color style, in color styles panel after 3 dotts, click on + New Style, add a title for that style. 
##### If used on multiple elements, color (style) with update on all elements, on change

#### When draging and droping something in frame in Figma, make sure your mouse cursor is in the frame when you release the mouse button

#### If you want to drag perfectly horisontal or vertical hold down SHIFT key while doing it. Also works for 15degrees step when rotating.

### Prototyping 

#### Animation type - smart animate is best to use when elements are doing multiple changes, moving, resizing, opacity...

#### While playing prototype, press R key to reload/restart the playing of prototype

#### Form animating color chnge on links hover
##### Instead of copying the entire frame to change state of single element for animation - copy just the elem, frame that elem, create interaction for while hovering - open overlay - manual - desolve
