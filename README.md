#### To create a new color style, in color styles panel after 3 dotts, click on + New Style, add a title for that style. 
##### If used on multiple elements, color (style) with update on all elements, on change

#### When draging and droping something in frame in Figma, make sure your mouse cursor is in the frame when you release the mouse button

### Prototyping 

#### Animation type - smart animate is best to use when elements are doing multiple changes, moving, resizing, opacity...

#### While playing prototype, press R key to reload/restart the playing of prototype

#### Form animating color chnge on links hover
##### Instead of copying the entire frame to change state of single element for animation - copy jsut the elem, frame that elem, create interaction for while hovering - open overlay - manual - desolve
